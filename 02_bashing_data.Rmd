In 01_ we started explporing and downloading data. We ended up with a .tsv
file with all the data information we are interested in. Let's explore how we
can use bash to explore the table and learn some more unix commands.

Let's start with some of the very basics to get everybody on the same page:

cd - to change directories
ls - list the files
pwd - tells you the pathway you are currently at (very useful actually!)
```
cd ~/
ls
pwd
```
Wait could there be more? let's try:

```
ls -lah
```
Do you see new files and folders that start with .X ? These are invisible files
that are often very important. the -lah is called a flag that gives us more information. Let's see what they are 

```
man ls
```
-l for long
-a for all
-h human readable
basically I typically always use these flags

Now let's make a new file using touch

```
touch test.txt
ls
```
woah a new file shows up! What is in it? lets use Nano

```
nano test.txt
# type whatever
# ctrl x to get out and enter
```

Now let's take a look at the file with cat

```
cat test.txt
```
Cat will print all items in a file and sometimes they are very long. So there are other unix commands to get the head and tail of a file while specificying how many lines you want:

```
head -10 test.txt
tail -10 test.txt
```

Let's make another file and combine two files to highlight other functinality of the cat command

```
tocuh test2.txt
nano test2.txt
# type whatever
cat test.txt test2.txt > test3.txt
cat test3.txt
```

now let's make a folder to put all these files in use mkdir

```
mkdir practice
ls -lah
```

let's move the files in there 

```
mv test2.txt /practice
mv test3.txt /practice
mv test.txt / practice
ls
```

Nice and tidy. However that could be quite laborious if you wanted to move a bunch of files. So we can use WILDCARDS

```
mv *.txt /practice
ls
```
This will move any file that ends in .txt the star means anything counts :)
There are many useful wild cards such as ? , [] etc here:

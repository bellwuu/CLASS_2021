Today we will install nextflow and install the Chip-seq pipeline. This way we can
run hundreds of ChIP-seq files simultaneously through, alignments, qc, peak calling
-- all the stuff you would ever want (even bigwig files for browsing raw data).

Nextflow has amazing documentation and a good place to start is here:

https://www.nextflow.io/docs/latest/getstarted.html



****************
Step 1 install:
****************

Next flow will install itself with this simple commmand below. However, you will
want to think about where to install it. When you know where you want it (usually
home directory or fairly high level up).

I installed nextflow in home directory so output error messages etc are always
located here:

/Users/jori2700/.nextflow/assets/nf-core/chipseq/main.nf

The main.nf will have all the code Nextflow's pipeline is running. If the pipeline
has an error it will send you to the line of code in main.nf that failed.

Alrighty, give it a go:

```{BASH}

wget -qO- https://get.nextflow.io | bash

```

Nice it's installed just like that! See what all you got in the .nextflow dir.

If you ever want to update nextflow just run the above. at the time of this doc
it is at: v20.10.0

****************
Step 2: $PATH
****************

The path is a default place the computer will look for commands. Imagine you
had to tell Bash where list is?

you would have to type something like this

~/jori2700/.bash/ls to list files -- 

Instead of ls

So that path is an important aspect of unix/bash that you will never really hear
about until it becomes a bug :) Just to be safe let's add nextflow to our $PATH

```{BASH}

$PATH
# kinda hard to read with : seperated file
# we can make it easier to read with TRANSFORM (tr) a powerful bash command to
# repalce and find text. 
echo $PATH | tr ":" "\n"
# echo is just goint to print out the $PATH variable and pipe to transform to
#take the : and make it a new line (\n) --- ahhh so much nicer to read!

```

Now let's add to the $PATH 

!! Warning the order in the $PATH matters !! The computer will search for the
first usage of the command -- so if there are two commands with similar names 
be careful the first one will be used and may not be the intended program called.


We will use the script to tell the time as script in a new folder we are going to 
make -- that is NOT in our $PATH. Look throuhg the bash for tr, cut, but don't 
worry about the bash we are just using this to make a program in a folder and add
to our $PATH

Run each of these lines in a row. 
```{BASH}

mkdir time_script
cd time_script

cat >> what-time-is-it.sh << 'EOF'
#!/bin/bash

current_time=$(date | tr -s " " "\t" | cut -f 4 | cut -d ":" -f 1,2)

echo "The time is $current_time.
I'm glad to see you're making good use of it :)"

EOF

chmod +x what-time-is-it.sh

ls
cat what-time-is-it.sh

## Notice it wrote out the file what-time-is-it with the "cat >>" command.
```

Ok so we have a time telling script that only works in the current directory:

This is where I made it:

/Users/jori2700/CLASS/time_script

So now we can add this to $PATH and run the script whenever just like ls, cat etc.

First we are going to add the .sh script to our $PATH temporarily.

```{BASH}

pwd
#copy and paste path to the directoy the .sh script is in


export PATH="$PATH:/Users/Users/jori2700/CLASS/time_script"
what_time_is_it.sh #(notice we don't need the ./ now that the path is set)

```


Now how to permenantly add to you $PATH

```{BASH}

echo 'export PATH="$PATH:/Users/jori2700/CLASS/time_script"' >> ~/.bash_profile
# nice let's take a look
echo $PATH | tr ":" "\n"
# we need to activate our new $PATH with
source ~/.bash_profile

cd anywhere
what-time-is-it.sh
```

Voila we can use the script anytime. Also this is a nice idea to have new scripts
etc in this folder as they will automatically be in $PATH now.

Let's add nextflow to our $PATH

```{BASH}

cd ~/
ls -lah
cd .nextflow
pwd
#/Users/jori2700/.nextflow
echo 'export PATH="$PATH:/Users/jori2700/.nextflow"' >> ~/.bash_profile
source ~/.bash_profile #or start a new session.
```

Alright we have next flow installed and we never have to worry about fiji finding
the commands again!


****************
Step 3: SLURM
****************


nextflow pull nf-core/chipseq

-r 1.2.1


## TODO ## for some reason i am still running older nextflow is it because I added 
to my path and then updated after?

## Also can't see to update chip-seq pipeline -- should we use the same as before?


## Bash ps command to print all current processes running abit cumbersume can 
pipe to grep.

tail -f to follow process updates

Step 4: Design file
